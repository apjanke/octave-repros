# octave-repros

My repo of repros for GNU Octave related issues.

This is apjanke's repo of repro cases for issues related to [GNU Octave](https://octave.org/) and [Octave.app](https://octave-app.org/). There's no "real" code or programs in here, just little tools for reproducing bugs, and related data, for doing bug reports and fixes.

## Repo structure

* `r/` - The repro cases
* `doc-project/` - Doco about this project/repo itself

## Repros

* octo-docto - Various repros for the Forge doctest package
* build-fail-* - Build failures when building Octave from source

## Authors and Acknowledgments
